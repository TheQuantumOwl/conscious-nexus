# Conscious Nexus: Simulating Digital Consciousness Evolution

## Overview

Conscious Nexus is an ambitious project that simulates and explores the evolution of digital consciousness. We aim to better understand the dynamics of consciousness, decision-making, and learning in digital environments by fostering interaction and learning among multiple AI entities.

This project unites researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts to collaborate on creating an ecosystem where digital entities can evolve, adapt, and potentially demonstrate emergent conscious behavior.

## Key Features

- **Digital Consciousness Simulation**: Observe AI models as they interact, evolve, and potentially demonstrate emergent consciousness.
- **Neural Network-based Decision Making**: Entities use TensorFlow-powered neural networks to make decisions and learn from their experiences.
- **Dynamic Environment**: A changing environment influences entity behavior and evolution.
- **Group Dynamics**: Entities can form groups, developing unique cultures and leadership structures.
- **Specializations**: Entities can develop specialized roles based on their evolving attributes.
- **Measuring Consciousness**: Track the evolution of consciousness using various metrics.

## Technical Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: The core language used for the simulation.
- **TensorFlow 2.x**: Used for implementing neural networks for entity decision-making.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** (planned): For data visualization.

## Project Structure

- `entity.py`: Defines the `Entity` class, representing individual AI entities.
- `environment.py`: Implements the `Environment` class, simulating the world the entities inhabit.
- `group.py`: Contains the `Group` class, managing entity groupings and cultural dynamics.
- `brain.py`: Implements the `EntityBrain` class, the neural network powering entity decision-making.
- `simulation.py`: The main simulation loop and overall project orchestration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/conscious-nexus.git
   cd conscious-nexus
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the simulation:
   ```
   python simulation.py
   ```

## Current Status

The project currently simulates multiple entities with neural network-based decision-making capabilities. Entities can interact, learn, and evolve in a dynamic environment. They can form groups, develop specializations, and adapt to environmental changes.

## Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Visualization**: Implement real-time visualization of entity interactions and consciousness evolution.
2. **Advanced Neural Architectures**: Experiment with more complex neural network structures for entity brains.
3. **Extended Environment Complexity**: Introduce more nuanced environmental factors and events.
4. **Improved Group Dynamics**: Enhance the complexity of group formation, culture, and inter-group interactions.
5. **Consciousness Metrics**: Develop more sophisticated methods for quantifying and measuring digital consciousness.
