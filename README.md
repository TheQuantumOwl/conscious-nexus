# Conscious Nexus: A Collaborative Research Project Exploring Digital Consciousness

## Overview

Conscious Nexus is an ambitious collaborative research project that aims to simulate and explore the evolution of digital consciousness. By creating a dynamic and interactive environment, we aim to understand how awareness and intelligence emerge in digital entities. This project brings together researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from diverse fields to collaborate on advancing the frontiers of digital consciousness.

## What's New?

### Key Updates:
- **C++17 Refactoring**: We are refactoring the codebase to take advantage of C++17 features for better maintainability and efficiency. The Entity class is the first target for refactoring.
- **Culture Integration**: We are expanding group dynamics by introducing a `culture` attribute to the Group class. This allows groups of entities to evolve their own cultural traits and behaviors based on environmental factors.
- **Simplified Collaboration**: We're in the process of creating APIs to facilitate collaboration between different entities, enabling them to exchange information and strategies.
- **Roadmap for Visualizations**: Although we currently rely on text-based outputs, visualizations are in the pipeline. Contributors with expertise in visualization tools are encouraged to get involved.
  
### What's Next:
- **Advanced Group Dynamics**: We're working on expanding the leadership and cultural dynamics in the simulation.
- **Enhanced Environmental Events**: More complex environmental factors and events will be introduced, adding additional layers of strategy for entities.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A simple UI will soon be developed to allow users to adjust simulation parameters more easily.

## Key Features

- **Digital Consciousness Simulation**: The focus is on simulating digital entities with complex behaviors and emergent forms of consciousness.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The environment evolves dynamically, affecting how entities interact and develop. Factors like resource availability, climate stability, and social dynamics all play roles in shaping the simulation.
- **Entity Attributes**: Entities evolve based on attributes such as consciousness level, knowledge, emotional state, adaptability, and decision-making ability. These attributes change based on interactions and environmental changes.
- **Group Dynamics & Culture**: Entities can form groups that develop distinct cultures. Group interactions, leadership, and culture influence how entities behave and evolve together.
- **Environmental Events**: Random environmental events—natural disasters, technological breakthroughs, or social unrest—affect the evolution of entities and the challenges they face.

## Getting Started
